//     In your example, this.handleClick.bind(this) is crucial for ensuring that the this context inside the handleClick method refers to the instance of your React class.

// When you use .bind(this), you explicitly bind the context of this to the instance of the React class. Here’s what’s happening:

// When the button is clicked, the handleClick method is called.

// By binding this in the constructor, you ensure that this inside the handleClick method refers to the instance of the React class, allowing it to access this.server.

// If you don't use .bind(this), here’s what would happen:

// You attach the event listener to the button.

// When the button is clicked, the handleClick method is called, but this inside handleClick will refer to the button element, not your React class instance.

// This means this.server will be undefined, because the button element doesn't have a server property.
